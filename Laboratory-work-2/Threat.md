| 1  | Store Data | Spoofing | Spoofing of Destination Data Store Data Storage |Data Storage may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of Data Storage. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.|
| 2  | Retrieve Data | Information Disclosure | Weak Access Control for a Resource | Improper data protection of Data Storage can allow an attacker to read information not intended for disclosure. Review authorization settings. |
| 3  | Processed Data | Elevation Of Privilege | Elevation Using Impersonation | Data Management may be able to impersonate the context of Data Processing in order to gain additional privilege. |
| 4  | Store Data | Denial Of Service | Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for Data Processing or Data Storage | Does Data Processing or Data Storage take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout. |
| 5  | User Commands | Tampering | Potential Lack of Input Validation for Game Application | Data flowing across User Commands may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Game Application or an elevation of privilege attack against Game Application or an information disclosure by Game Application. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach. |
| 6  | Game Feedback | Repudiation | External Entity Human User Potentially Denies Receiving Data | Human User claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data. |
| 7  | Retrieve Data | Spoofing | Spoofing of Source Data Store Data Storage | Data Storage may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to incorrect data delivered to Data Processing. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source data store. |
| 8  | Send Data | Elevation Of Privilege | Elevation Using Impersonation | Game Application may be able to impersonate the context of Data Management in order to gain additional privilege. |
| 9  | Game Feedback | Denial Of Service | Data Flow Game Feedback Is Potentially Interrupted | An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction. |
| 10  | User Commands | Elevation Of Privilege | Game Application May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution | Human User may be able to remotely execute code for Game Application. |
